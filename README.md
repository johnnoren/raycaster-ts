# Raycaster

Simple raycaster written in Typescript that uses a digital differential analyzer (DDA) algorithm to calculate the distance to walls in an efficient manner.

It generates a random maze and let's you walk around in it. Not really a game at the moment but can be turned into one.

It runs in the browser and you can [try it here](https://raycaster-ts.netlify.app/).
